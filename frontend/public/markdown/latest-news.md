# August Newsletter

Welcome back to school, longhorns! We're kicking off the season with a lot of new updates- including this website (which I slapped together last minute, so please treat it kindly). We have more resources to ease the learning curve for our new members, and fun lectures and events for everyone! 

The first meeting of the semester will take place on Friday, September 5th in EER 1.504 from 3-5 PM. Show up to learn more about what we do and meet other people who are interested in combat robotics! See our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=dGhlZXhwZXJpbWVudGFsZGl2aXNpb25AZ21haWwuY29t) for more information about the meetings! 


And if you want to see us before the first meeting (because we all missed John over the summer), please swing by our table on Speedway! We're tabling the entire first week of school.
